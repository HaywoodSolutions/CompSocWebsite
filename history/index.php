29th September 2005
Compsoc will be holding a Society General Meeting on Monday 10th October at 1730 in COLT2 (Map: COLT2, Computing Laboratory, Canterbury Campus).

This meeting is a chance for you to become a member of Compsoc if you wish. Please note that you will not be allowed to vote if you are not a paid-up member. Membership fees (as previously floated to all the members) for 05/06 are £3.

This meeting is also a chance for you to have motions voted on by other members of the society. If a motion is passed, then the committee is bound to carry it out. The rules regarding motions are available in the SocietyConstitution.

However, as nobody has paid up their membership fees, the committee has elected to accept motions from any interested parties, and these will be put to a vote on the strict condition that both the proposer and seconder are fully paid-up members at the time of the vote.

Motions must be submitted to compsoc-committee@kent.ac.uk by 17:30:00 BST on Monday 3rd October.

Further, we strongly suggest that if you want to propose any motion at all, but *particularly* a constitutional one, you should make the effort to do it at this coming SGM, as, unless members join and then disappear, we will automatically have the quorum necessary.

In other news, minutes from the committees latest meeting are available on the website. Also, please keep your eyes peeled for a constitutional change motion that will be arriving in your inboxes on Monday 3rd.

A failures page has been added to the website, detailing the 'services that never were': things we've tried to arrange but have been unable to do (mainly due to restrictions imposed by the university authorities). This is just to show that although the services we offer might not seem like enough, it's not through want of trying that we don't have more!

14/11/99 New Hard Drive for compsoc1 
CompSoc has made its first purchase of the year: a 20gb hard disk for compsoc1. This should be installed by early next week.

2/11/99 Members' Details 
We request that all current members help us to keep our databases up-to-date. It will really help us to help you if, using a UKC-networked computer, you would go to the membership details page and add your information. Please remember to enter your e-mail address.
